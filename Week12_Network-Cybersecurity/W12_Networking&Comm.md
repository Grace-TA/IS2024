### **1. What were the first four locations hooked up to the Internet (ARPANET)?**
The first four nodes of ARPANET were connected in 1969, marking the birth of the Internet. The locations were:
1. **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**: Served as the Network Measurement Center.
2. **Stanford Research Institute (SRI)**: Hosted the Augmentation Research Center.
3. **University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)**: Focused on application projects.
4. **University of Utah**: Worked on graphics projects.
These connections formed the initial framework of what would become the modern Internet.

### **2. What does the term packet mean?**
A **packet** is a small, discrete unit of data transmitted over a network. It includes:
- **Header**: Contains information such as source, destination, and protocol details.
- **Payload**: The actual data being transmitted.
- **Trailer** (optional): May include error-checking data.
Packets are fundamental to the process of packet switching, which is the method used by the Internet to transfer data efficiently.

### **3. Which came first, the Internet or the World Wide Web?**
The **Internet** came first.  
- The **Internet** originated in the late 1960s with ARPANET, which provided a network infrastructure for communication.
- The **World Wide Web (WWW)** was invented later, in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, as a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet.

### **4. What was revolutionary about Web 2.0?**
Web 2.0 revolutionized the Internet by transitioning from static, read-only web pages (Web 1.0) to interactive, user-generated content. Key features include:
- **Interactivity**: Enabled social networking, blogging, and collaborative platforms.
- **User-Generated Content**: Platforms like YouTube and Wikipedia allowed users to contribute.
- **Rich User Experiences**: Technologies like AJAX enabled dynamic and responsive interfaces.
Web 2.0 transformed the Internet into a participatory medium.

### **5. What was the so-called killer app for the Internet?**
The so-called **killer app** for the Internet was **email**.  
- Email revolutionized communication by allowing users to send and receive messages quickly and inexpensively.
- It was the first widely adopted application that drove the popularity and necessity of Internet use in both personal and business contexts.

### **6. What does the term VoIP mean?**
**VoIP** stands for **Voice over Internet Protocol**.  
- It is a technology that enables voice communication and multimedia sessions over the Internet.
- Examples include Skype, Zoom, and WhatsApp calling.
- It is cost-effective and has largely replaced traditional phone systems for many applications.

### **7. What is a LAN?**
A **LAN** (Local Area Network) is a network that connects devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or building.  
- Characteristics include high-speed connections and low latency.
- LANs are commonly used for sharing resources like files, printers, and Internet access among connected devices.

### **8. What is the difference between an intranet and an extranet?**
- **Intranet**: A private network accessible only to an organization's employees or members, used for internal communication and information sharing.
- **Extranet**: An extended network that allows access to certain parts of an intranet for external users, such as business partners, suppliers, or clients, typically through secure access controls.

---

### **9. What is Metcalfe’s Law?**
**Metcalfe’s Law** states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users.  
- Mathematically, **Value ∝ n²**, where **n** is the number of users.

- It highlights the exponential growth in value as more users join the network, making it more beneficial and attractive. This principle underpins the rapid growth of social networks and communication platforms.
