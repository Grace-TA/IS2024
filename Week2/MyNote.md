# What is Information System?

## What is Data? 

Definition: Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts, figures, and statistics that have no specific meaning on their own. Data is the foundational element in any Information System, but it requires processing and organization to become useful.

Classic Example: In a retail business, individual sales figures (e.g., "5 units sold," "$100 revenue") represent data.

## What is Information? 

Definition: Information is processed, organized, or structured data that has been transformed into a meaningful and useful form. It is data that has been interpreted to provide context, relevance, or insights for decision-making.

Classic Example: Taking the raw sales data (e.g., individual sales figures from different days) and creating a weekly sales report that shows total sales, average daily revenue, and best-selling products is information. 

## What is System?

Definition: A system is a collection of interconnected components or elements that work together in a structured way to achieve a specific purpose. In the context of Information Systems, it refers to the integration of hardware, software, data, people, and processes that collectively enable the storage, processing, and dissemination of information.

Classic Example: An Inventory Management System used in a warehouse is a classic example of a system. It consists of hardware (computers, barcode scanners), software (inventory management applications), data (stock levels, shipment details), people (warehouse staff), and processes (reordering, restocking) working together to ensure that stock levels are tracked and orders are fulfilled efficiently.
