## B. Will you purchase or suggest the 3 enterprise softwares for your company in future?

### Company Analysis: The company is a system integration company for R&D, Lab, QA with CRM as the top priority for business promotion, ERP as an optional demand due to its small team size, and SCM as unnecessary.

### Suggestion for CRM (Highest Priority)

1. **Salesforce CRM**  
   - **Why**: Salesforce is one of the most comprehensive CRM solutions available. It supports extensive business promotion, customer management, and sales automation. It's also scalable, which will accommodate business growth over time. Salesforce offers strong integration with marketing and service tools, making it ideal for a system integration company looking to streamline customer engagement and promotion.
   - **Pros**: Market leader, highly customizable, integrates with many platforms.
   - **Cons**: Cost can be high for small teams, but worth it for long-term scalability.

2. **HubSpot CRM**  
   - **Why**: HubSpot CRM is an excellent choice for small-to-medium-sized businesses that prioritize affordability and ease of use. Its free tier offers essential features that would benefit your team immediately, with the option to upgrade to more powerful marketing automation tools as the company grows.
   - **Pros**: Free version available, user-friendly, integrates marketing and sales.
   - **Cons**: Less customizable than Salesforce, but suitable for smaller operations.

### Suggestion for ERP (Optional)

3. **Oracle ERP Cloud**  
   - **Why**: As your team is smaller and might not need a fully-fledged ERP system, Oracle ERP Cloud can be implemented incrementally. It supports core operations like financial management and project management, which are essential for a growing company. This solution is scalable, meaning it can grow with your business.
   - **Pros**: Cloud-based, scalable for future growth, strong financial management tools.
   - **Cons**: May be overkill for a team of fewer than 50 people now, but it has future potential.

### Decision on SCM

- **Not Needed**: Since the company is not in manufacturing and doesn't have complex supply chain needs, SCM software would not provide much value.

### Conclusion:

For a system integration company with business promotion as a major focus, **Salesforce CRM** would be the top recommendation due to its extensive capabilities, but **HubSpot CRM** could also be a great option if budget and ease of use are major factors. **Oracle ERP Cloud** would be a suitable optional choice for ERP needs as your company grows, though it might not be necessary right away.
